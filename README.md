# Small Project for STIM 
Plan your next knitting project. Add what yarn and needles you need and link to the pattern. When you are done you can update the entry and save it to the "Done column".

# Not done

## State handing
Make sure we are not doing API calls if not needed.
Save to localStorage?
useContext, maybe a little overkill for an app this size. 

## Features
Upload image of knit when done 
Validering

## Errors
Eslint + TypeScript was not my best friend.
CORS headers issues in Chrome. Run in Safari.
